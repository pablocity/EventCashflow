# EventCashflow
App for managing cashflow between participants of plain old social meetings and events
When you organise a joint event with your friends, e.g. on New Year's Eve, or rent a sports hall to play with them,
it's always hard to track finances. This app is being created out of need for simple way to answer questions - who pays whom, for what and how much :)
